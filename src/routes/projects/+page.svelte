    <h2>DVLN.XYZ (this website!)</h2>
    <p>
      My personal website. It's built in Sveltekit, uses Supabase for
      authentication, database, and storage, Cloudflare for hosting, and Umami
      for analytics. It's still a work in progress and I try to write-up new
      features <a href="/posts">on my blog</a>.

    <h2>Siteimprove bookmarklet</h2>
    <p>
      Tiny utility bookmarklet to quickly deeplink a user onto the Siteimprove
      report of GOV.UK page they're currently looking at. Avoids having to log
      into Siteimprove, and navigate to the report page using menus and url
      searches.

    <h2>Whisper notes</h2>
    <p>
      A note transcription tool. It uses Whisper, OpenAI's general-purpose
      speech recognition model, to transcribe audio files. It allows the user to
      upload an audio file which is then sent to a python script for processing
      and transcription. The transcript is returned to the user in the browser.

    <h2>AI change note generator</h2>
    <p>
      A webapp for generating changes notes in the specific style Content
      Designers on GOV.UK need to use. It takes two versions of content, and
      using the Open AI API, gives the change notes back to the user.
