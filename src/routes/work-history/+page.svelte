<h1>Work history</h1>

<p>
  I am a solutions-focused writer and content designer with an eye for detail
  and the proven ability to get to the root of content design problems by
  “following the confusion”. I have a knack for finding annoyances and
  inefficiencies in processes, and coming up with bare-bones and budget-friendly
  improvements. I’m also a self-taught programmer, and have used this knowledge
  to improve processes for myself and my colleagues.

  <h2 class="job-title">
    Content Designer at <a
      href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service"
      >Government Digital Service (GDS)</a
    >
  </h2>
  <p class="time-period">March 2022 - Present</p>
  <p class="job-summary">
    I use evidence, data, and user research to inform my content design
    decisions, and ensure user needs are the primary driver of the content I
    write for GOV.UK. I also cultivate strong relationships with other
    government departments to share knowledge and content design best practice.
    I actively contribute to and adhere to the GOV.UK style guides and content
    patterns. I also contribute to rota and other work where needed, such as
    managing the content request queue, and working on government reshuffles out
    of hours.

  <p class="time-period">November 2018 - March 2022</p>
  <p class="job-summary">
    I was responsible for managing and producing content for the Goldsmiths
    website. This involved research, information synthesis, and structuring
    content, as well as measuring impact once content was live. I worked closely
    with academics to research and write engaging content about niche topics,
    and presented it in a way that was true to the degree programme but
    accessible to our target audiences. I also advised colleagues across the
    institution on accessibility best practices when producing content for the
    web.
